# Natural-Language-Processing-Text-Mining-Functions
Operations in  Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Text Mining technique. 

#Text Minig or Text Analytics is the process of extract meaningful information from natural language text.

#Natural Language Processing is a part of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence which deals with the interactions between computers and human(natural) languages.

@ Applications of NLP: 1.Sentiment Analysis  2.Chatbot  3.Speech Recognition 4.Machine Translation 

@Applications of NLP and Text Mining:1.Information Extraction 2.Spell Checking 3.Keyword Searching 4.Summarization 5.Advertisement Matching 6.Classification(Spam Filtering) 7.Question Answerning and others.....

@Tasks of Natural Language Processing: 1.Tokenization 2.Stemming 3.Lemmatization 4.Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
                                       5.Named Entity Recognition 6.Chunking
  
  *** when working with Text Mining that's time deal with "Stop Word Removal" step before the "Chunking" step.***

1.Tokenization:
  Tokenization(word segmentation) is the task of chopping it up into pieces(smaller meaningful elements) called tokens.Tokens can be words, numbers, or punctuation marks.This process is done by using a tokenization algorithm.
  
  Sentence Tokenization is the process of tokenizing a text into sentences.NLTK provides a method called sent_tokenize to perform sentence-level tokenization. 
  
  Word Tokenization is the process of tokenizing sentences or text into words and
punctuation.NLTK provides a method called word_tokenize ,which splits text using punctuation and non-
alphabetic characters.
